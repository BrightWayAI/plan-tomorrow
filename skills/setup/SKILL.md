name: setup
description: Configure plan-tomorrow for your CRM, working hours, calendar conventions, and companion-plugin integrations. Auto-fires on "/setup-plan", "set up plan-tomorrow", "configure daily planning", or when /plan-tomorrow reports user-context.md is missing.
---

See `commands/setup-plan.md` for the full interview.

## When this skill fires

- User runs `/setup-plan` directly
- User says: "set up plan-tomorrow", "configure my daily planning", "configure plan-tomorrow"
- The `/plan-tomorrow` command reports user-context.md is missing → auto-route here
- User installs the plugin and asks "how do I use this?"

## Quick path

If the user wants minimum-viable defaults to start: write a placeholder `references/user-context.md` with working hours 9–5, CRM "none," no companion plugins. The planner will work but will be limited to calendar + Gmail + manual user input. Recommend running the full interview when ready.
