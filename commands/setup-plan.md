# /setup-plan

Short interview that captures the context plan-tomorrow needs to actually be useful for you.

---

## Step 1 — Check for existing config

Read `references/user-context.md` if it exists.

- Populated → ask: "Update sections, or start over?"
- Missing → start fresh.

---

## Step 2 — The interview

One section at a time. Confirm before moving on.

### Section 1 — Identity
- Your name
- Your company
- One-sentence description of what you do

### Section 2 — Working hours
- Start of workday (e.g., 9:00 AM)
- End of workday (e.g., 5:00 PM)
- Time zone (e.g., America/New_York)
- Default block size for quick tasks (default 30 min)
- Default block size for deep work (default 60–90 min)
- Max task blocks per day (default 6)

### Section 3 — CRM
- Which CRM? (HubSpot / Salesforce / Pipedrive / Attio / other / "none")
- If "none" → note that CRM-task pulls will be skipped.
- Your CRM owner ID (if applicable)
- Status names that mean "needs work" (e.g., "NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS")
- Priority field name (e.g., "hs_task_priority")
- Priority values (e.g., HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)

### Section 4 — Calendar conventions
- Color ID for task blocks (Google Calendar uses "1"–"11"; default "5" Banana yellow)
- Emoji map for block types — defaults: deep work 🔨, emails 📧, meeting prep 📝, capture 📋, buffer 🔲
- Send-updates default — usually "none" for personal blocks (recommended; otherwise attendees get spammed)

### Section 5 — Companion plugin integrations
- Is `claude-cortex` installed? (Y/N — drives whether memory is read)
- Is `core-ops` installed? (Y/N — drives whether `pipeline-analyst` is delegated to)
- Is `weekly-outreach` installed? (Y/N — drives whether outreach contacts are pulled from the weekly queue)

### Section 6 — Optional preferences
- Always include a buffer block? (Y/N, default Y)
- Always include post-call capture if external meetings happened? (Y/N, default Y)
- Default outreach block size if applicable (default 30 min)
- Anything else that should be a block on every day? (e.g., "30 min reading first thing")

## Step 4 — Confirm and offer next step

Summarize what was saved (one short paragraph). Offer:
> "Try `/plan-tomorrow` to plan your next workday."

---

## Behavior rules

- One section at a time. Don't bombard.
- Skip what doesn't apply. "I don't have a CRM" is a valid answer.
- Idempotent. Re-running updates without re-doing finished sections.
